LESSON4: DOCKER LIFECYCLE
docker run = docker create + docker start

CMD-CLI syntax: docker create <IMAGE_NAME> 
  -> It will create container for that image to run. So it will install the software for the image in the allocated memory of the container.
  -> RETURN: It will return the container Id in which it started

CMD-CLI syntax: docker start <CONTAINER_ID> : 
  -> It will run the start up command for container which have included <CONTAINER_ID> in command.
  -> RETURN: Normally it won't display the output of the startup command. If you need so you need to add "-a" flag to the command.
                docker start -a <CONTAINER_ID>
  Flags: 
    -< a: will return the output of the command in cli.
