LESSON7: RETRIEVING THE LOGS OF A CONTAINER
If you want the output of the container:
STEPS: 
    1. run docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>

LESSON8: STOPPING A CONTAINER
see in the notes

LESSON10: EXECUTING COMMANDS INSIDE THE CONTAINER
    CMD-CLI syntax: docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> <COMMAND>
        So by using the <COMMAND> we can open the cli and continue to enter our commands
        FLAG IT: helps to enter the command through keyboard. Without this flag we can't enter the command

LESSON11: WHY DO WE NEED IT FLAG?

    Docker is running in LINUX Virtual Machine.Every process in Linux have three communication channels
        1. STDIN: This is the things we type from keyboard to the process.
        2. STDOUT: This is from process to the screen.
        3. STDERR: This is error from the process to the screen.

    IT flag is basically a combination of two flags -i -t
        -i: This commands connects our terminal to the STDIN and STDOUT channel of the image.
        -t: This commands prettifies the output from the image shown in the terminal through STDOUT.
    
LESSON11: GETTING A COMMAND PROMPT IN A CONTAINER:

    CMD-CLI: docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> sh
    So it runs the shell inside the container opening shell. Thus allows us to using shell inside the container

LESSON12: SHELL CONCEPTS:
    To Exit From the Shell, you need to press CTRL + D or use exit command

LESSON14: CONTAINER ISOLATION:
    Until we specifically create connection between containers they are isolated. They not even share file systems i.e A directory or file created in one container won't be present in other.
